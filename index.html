                    <h3>UI UX Design</h3>
                    <p>UI/UX design aims to create a positive user experience that encourages customers to stick with a
                        brand or product. While a UX Designer decides how the user interface works, the UI designer
                        decides how the user interface looks. This article is a comprehensive guide on how to become a
                        UI UX Designer and discusses other relevant topics related to the UI UX field.
